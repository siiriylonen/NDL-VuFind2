  <h2>Finna – search services as a whole</h2>
  <p>Finna consists of Finna.fi, a site that brings all materials together, and other Finna search services. At Finna.fi, you can find the materials of all members of Finna, including archives, libraries and museums. Other Finna search services focus on specific materials and services. Further information: <a href="https://finna.fi/Content/about">Search services as a whole</a>.
  </p>
  <p>The National Library of Finland is responsible for the maintenance of Finna.fi and the general development of Finna services with its partners. CSC – IT Centre for Science also participates in the provision of Finna services. On this page, you can find information about the processing of personal data in Finna by the National Library of Finland and CSC. You can also find instructions for how to contact material providers regarding personal data in certain material.
  </p>
  <p>The members of Finna are responsible for the modification of their own Finna search services and the related processing of personal data. Additional services that are not maintained by the National Library of Finland or CSC may be offered in separate Finna search services. If the search service you use includes additional services in which personal data are processed, you can find more information on this page.
  </p>
  <h2>Processing the data of registered users in Finna</h2>
  <p>When a user logs in to Finna at Finna.fi or in other Finna search services, the following data will be stored in the service, depending on the login method:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-bullets">
    <li>When logging in with a library card, the user’s library card number, PIN code, first and last name, email address and home library are stored on the service. The data is automatically transferred to Finna from the library that issued the card.
    </li>
    <li>When logging in using Haka, the username, name and email address are stored on Finna.
    </li>
    <li>When logging in using Finna, Finna stores the information that was provided when the Finna ID was created, i.e. the email address and username. Persons under the age of 13 will need permission from a legal guardian to create an ID.
    </li>
    <li>When logging in using an email address, data about the user’s name, email address and home library is saved.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Information is collected and managed for the execution of the Finna service at the National Library of Finland and CSC – IT Centre for Science (service providers).
  </p>
  <p>This information is stored for the following purposes:
  </p>
  <table class="content-table">
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Information</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Purpose</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Username</th>
      <td>User authentication</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Email</th>
      <td>Default address for email, can be edited by the user on Finna. When logging in with an email address: sending the login link to the email address stored in the patron information of the library.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>First name</th>
      <td>Showing information to a logged in user</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Last name</th>
      <td>Showing information to a logged in user</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Library card number</th>
      <td>User authentication</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>PIN code</th>
      <td>User authentication for service interfaces</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Home library</th>
      <td>Default pick-up location for holds, can be edited by the user on Finna</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>In Finna search services, users can also save and modify their own data. Finna will only send emails requested by the user to the email address stored on Finna. These can include due date reminders and new entry alerts.
  </p>
  <p>In addition to the data mentioned above, Finna may store data as a consequence of the user’s activity in Finna. For example, such information includes the language(s) used, the most recent login date and time, data about payments made through Finna and their date for the investigation of any errors, receiving due date reminders and new entry alerts, records saved in your lists, library cards, comments, reviews and tags you have added.
  </p>
  <p>Other services that process data about library users, including browsing borrowed and reserved materials, making reservations, renewing loans, and registering as a customer, use the service interfaces of the library system, and do not store any information on Finna, with the exception of optional due date reminders. The ID number of the loan and the due date are stored on the service when sending out due date reminders. This information helps to ensure that each due date reminder is sent out only once.
  </p>
  <p>The Finna accounts created using library card, Finna and Haka IDs are separate from each other, even if they contain the same unique identifier.
  </p>
  <p>You may at any time delete your information on Finna by closing your account on the service. All data is automatically deleted once more than 18 months have passed since you last logged into the service. After your account has been removed, any comments and feedback you may have provided will remain anonymous; that is, it does not contain your personal data. If you would also like to delete your comments and reviews, you will need to do so manually before closing the account. As a Finna user, you can request information about how your personal information is used by contacting the service administrator at the National Library using the <a href="https://finna.fi/Feedback/Home">Finna.fi feedback form</a>. As a user of Finna search services, you have the right to review and correct your personal information.
